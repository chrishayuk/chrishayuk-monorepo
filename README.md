# Introduction
This is the chrishayuk monorepo that essentially powers the chrishayuk youtube channel.

This repo has a dual purpose, to test out and create new ideas, as well as making the channel simpler.

As it stands this really covers react and javascript based solutions, but will figure out the best method of handling multi-mono repos.

This will evolve over time.
